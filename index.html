        <div class="subheading mb-5">Biology Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a freshman studying Biology at the University of California Riverside. 
        From the start I have been very dedicated towards my studies and seek to accomplish all my intended goals for the future. 
        I am involved in various clubs and a research lab on campus which also gives me the opportunity to contribute my knowledge towards something I have a drive for. 
        I strive to complete my undergraduate years and apply to the Early Assurance program offered by UCR, giving myself an early start on the road to medical school. 
        In pursuit of this I have participated in various volunteering, research and other activities that will impact my application in a positive way. 
        One way I have taken advantage of these opportunities was by becoming a part of the COPE Health Scholars Program where I have prospered over the few months I have been there. 
        The health scholar program has been something that has taught me to become a well-rounded individual. 
        Since our core focus is revolved on patient care this program has always taught me to be up on my feet and provide the best care possible. 
        I have also developed other skills along the way with the help of this program such as understanding the value of time, being more responsible, caring and knowing how to communicate with patients.<br><br>

        As for the more academic side I am also involved in Dr. Connie Nugent’s research lab which studies the effect of telomere shifting on cancer. 
        The most recent lab I have been a part of that has fueled my interest in research has been the Dynamic Genome lab directed by Dr. Jamie Van Norman.
        We learned important and essential skills that would be considered basic yet an important foundation for all labs.
        A huge part of the class required for the mastering of basic lab techniques such as utilizing micropipettes to carry out accurate measurements of solutions along with performing gel electrophoresis for PCR (polymerase chain reactions). 
        In addition, Dynamic Genome also taught me basic intrapersonal skills as I was required to present my research to the whole class of students and instructors. 
        Doing this allowed me to strengthen my communication skills and broaden my knowledge regarding certain topics far beyond my imagination. 
        The main goal behind this lab was to lay the foundation of an important research project that was further continued once we finished the class. <br><br>

        I have also participated in a lot of leadership activities such as being a team leader during my time as a future physician leader member. 
        Given a team my task was to spread the information about a certain vial that would immediate medical responses to all the hospitals, fire departments and police stations within the Inland Empire.
        I am glad to say that in the end we achieved our goal and even made a presentation regarding its success.
        My goal is to eventually use all this experience and knowledge to create for myself a window that would allow me to further excel my aspirations and interests of attending medical school. <br><br>
